<p class="style11">UD polo began in the Fall of 2005. The team was founded by "The Godfather" Craig Eckbold, a transfer from Millersville University in PA. The original team was based around Phil Bafundo, Julia Bonfante, Bill Day and a group of ex-swimmers. In it's first year, the club grew to about 25 people. Initially, Craig did all of the coaching, but as other players gained knowledge and experience, they too began to take leadership roles. </p>
           
 <p class="style11">The team's first season was laid back and they only played a few scrimmage/games against Millersville, Lehigh, and other nearby teams. In the spring of 2006, they had a similar schedule with a few weekend tournaments, where Craig's future-wife would read the players bed-time stories when they returned home in the early morning hours. </p>

<p class="style11">In the Fall of 2006, with a practice group of almost 40 kids and a competition roster beefed up with more ex-swimmers, the team decided to join the Collegiate Water Polo Association and became a member of the Mid-Atlantic Division alongside traditional powerhouse programs like Penn State, Slippery Rock, and Villanova. After Craig and the original group graduated, players like Andrew Malinak, Kelsey Paras, and Joe Fugelo carried the torch ad continued the tradition of competition and celebration.</p>

            <p class="style11">Now, 7 years after its beginnings, the University of Delaware Water Polo Team has undoubtedly grown and improved an astonishing amount. This fall, the team finished 3rd out of 15 teams in the Mid-Atlantic Division and had two players named to the All-Conference teams. President and Coach Josh Humberston also received coach of the year. Delaware's water polo team has come to be a well respected and challenging team to beat for anyone in the conference. Delware now looks eagerly to a conference championship next year!</p>
